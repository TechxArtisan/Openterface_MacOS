[Openterface Mini-KVM](https://openterface.com/quick-start/) allows you to control a headless target device, such as a mini PC, kiosk, or server, directly from your laptop or desktop without the need for an extra keyboard, mouse, and monitor.

It's a plug-and-play tool that connects via HDMI for display and USB for emulated keyboard/mouse (HID) signals. It requires minimal setup: install our host application on your host computer, and you're ready to have on-the-go headless control.

Whether you're an IT professional needing to troubleshoot a server, a developer managing multiple tests on edge computing machines, a tech enthusiast hacking single-board computers, or simply someone looking to declutter their desk, Openterface Mini-KVM is the solution.

Check out [use cases](https://openterface.com/use-cases/) and some early [demos](https://openterface.com/basic-testing/) demonstrating the basic operation of our host application.

## ðŸš€ **Let's shake things up in KVM technology together!**

We're hard at work developing [the host applications](https://openterface.com/quick-start/#install-host-application) for this handy gadget. Our team is coding away and tweaking these tools to boost their performance and functionality.

Admittedly, this is an early stage of development, which means the code might be a bit messy and full of bugs ðŸ˜…. We're all ears for any criticism and constructive suggestions on code, software framework, current feature design flaws, and potential new features.

Moreover, if you are interested in joining our dev team and [contributing](https://openterface.com/contributing/), you can drop me an email at: info@techxartisan.com

We keep our community updated on all things Openterface Mini-KVM on our Reddit: [r/Openterface_miniKVM/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Openterface_miniKVM/). You can also join us on Discord [TechxArtisan](https://discord.gg/sFTJD6a3R8), especially for development-related discussions! Cheers!
